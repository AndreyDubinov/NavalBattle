# NavalBattle
This is the simple classic game - Naval Battle, or Sea Battle.
I create this project only for increase my knowledge in Java. So I do not use any framework in this project.

Constructive criticism is welcome!

Naval Battle is the game where you must sunk all ship in the enemy fleet.
In basic variant both fleet contains 10 ship of 4 different type.
In this version you play with computer, the location of the ship is generated randomly.
This is not a bug, this is feature :)
